# Weather App Project

For this project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Curriculum, I built a global weather application that can show you the weather in any city using async JS and multiple APIs.

### New Skills / Knowledge
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Dynamic User Interface Interactions
- Form validation with Javascript
- Asynchronous Javascript (promises, resolve, reject, .then, await)
- APIs (fetch, API Keys, Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS))
